If my server is currently running then the project can be accessed at https://app.emojdle.com/airlines

Otherwise, clone the repo and run `npm install` within the server folder
Then, change the `serverLocation` variable in `public/index.html` from "https://app.emojdle.com/airlines/" to "http://localhost:3000/airlines/"
Then, while in the server directory, run `javac *.java`
Then start the server by running `node server.js` in the server folder. Then you can access the app at http://localhost:3000/airlines
