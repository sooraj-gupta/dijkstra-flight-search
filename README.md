If my server is currently running then the project can be accessed at https://app.emojdle.com/airlines

Otherwise, clone the repo and run `npm install` within the backend folder
Then, change the `serverLocation` variable in `index.html` from "https://app.emojdle.com/airlines" to "http://localhost:3000/airlines"
Then start the server by running `node server.js` in the backend folder. Then you can access the app at http://localhost:3000/airlines
